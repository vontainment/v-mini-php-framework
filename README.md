# PHP Framework Template

## Overview
This PHP framework template is designed to provide a simple yet robust structure for developing web applications. It includes fundamental components like routing, controllers, models, views, and database interactions.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to your local machine or server.
- Configure your web server to point to the `public/` directory.
- Ensure `.htaccess` is properly set up to handle URL rewrites.

## Configuring the Framework
- Edit `config/database.php` with your database credentials.
- Update `lib/database.php` with methods for interacting with the database.
- Implement routing logic in `public/index.php`.

## Building Your Application
- Create controllers in `app/controllers/` to handle user requests.
- Define models in `app/models/` for your application's data and business logic.
- Add views in `app/views/` to render HTML content.
- Utilize the base controller and model in `lib/` to create standardized functionality.

## Notes
- Extend and customize the framework as needed for your specific application requirements.
- Keep the framework updated with the latest security practices and dependencies.
